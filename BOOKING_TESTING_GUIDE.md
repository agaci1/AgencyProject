# üöÄ Complete Booking & Payment Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **State Persistence**: Booking progress now saves to localStorage and survives page refreshes
2. **PayPal Loading**: Improved PayPal SDK loading with better error handling and fallback client ID
3. **Payment Flow**: Fixed PayPal button rendering and payment processing
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved all type issues in the booking form

## üîß **Environment Setup Required:**

### **For Local Development:**
Create `agency.frontend/.env.local` with:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AZiaAPXJQxzMqKGYAS49_T2fu-ihY700Kivl-8CqSkusYh48ee-9MXH-fszfpBhwkW9UjUjj8fraw99U
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CURRENCY=EUR
```

### **For Production (Railway Frontend Service):**
Add these environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://agencyproject-production-dbfc.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AZiaAPXJQxzMqKGYAS49_T2fu-ihY700Kivl-8CqSkusYh48ee-9MXH-fszfpBhwkW9UjUjj8fraw99U
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CURRENCY=EUR
```

## üß™ **Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Tours Display**
1. Visit your website: `https://rilindishpk.com`
2. Check if tours are visible in the "Our Top Tours" section
3. If tours are not showing, the frontend-backend connection needs to be fixed

### **Step 2: Test Booking Flow**
1. Click on any tour card to open the booking form
2. Fill in the booking details:
   - Trip Type: One Way or Round Trip
   - Departure Date: Select a future date
   - Return Date: (if round trip)
   - Number of Guests: 1-50
   - Special Requests: (optional)
3. Click "Continue to Payment"
4. **Test State Persistence**: Refresh the page - you should stay on the payment step
5. **Test Going Back**: Click "Back to Details" - your form data should be preserved

### **Step 3: Test PayPal Payment**
1. On the payment page, wait for PayPal to load (shows loading spinner)
2. Click the PayPal button when it appears
3. **Test Guest Checkout**: Choose "Pay with Debit or Credit Card" (no PayPal account needed)
4. Use PayPal Sandbox test credentials:
   - **Email**: `sb-47bqhz12345678@business.example.com`
   - **Password**: `12345678`
5. Complete the payment
6. Verify booking is created and confirmation message appears

### **Step 4: Test Error Handling**
1. **Network Issues**: Disconnect internet and try to load payment page
2. **PayPal Errors**: Try with invalid card details
3. **Backend Errors**: Check browser console for API errors
